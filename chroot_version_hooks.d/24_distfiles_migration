# Previously distfiles were stored entirely in the chroot, forcing us
# to download it everytime.  This content is now stored externally, exposed
# to the chroot via mount binds.
#
# What we're doing here is moving any existing content from the old locations,
# into the new locations- which will already have a mount bind in place.
# If it *doesn't*, meaning parallel cros_sdk usage, we just wipe the content
# (user can redownload it after all).
#
# Once that's done, upgrade the chroot directory structure installing
# syms pointing back to the new location.
