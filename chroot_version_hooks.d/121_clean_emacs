# Clean out old emacs versions that people installed by hand.  Since they've
# moved and have blockers, portage often won't auto-resolve the upgrade.
# This doesn't mean people need to manually recover -- normally they will have
# virtual/emacs installed which will automatically pull back in emacs.
