# Having revved dev-libs/protobuf to 2.6.1 in the SDK, we need to rebuild stuff
# that dynamically links against the libraries it installs.
# Unfortunately, using the in-build emerge logic for rebuilding all the
# reverse-dependencies of protobuf seems to blow up pretty terribly
# (including gcc and icedtea for some reason?) so let's just rebuild the
# things we know to be required.
